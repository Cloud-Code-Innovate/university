# Provision Visual Builder Cloud Service Instance

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to quickly provision an Visual Builder Cloud Service on Oracle Cloud. In this lab we will create Mobile application which will take photo of ID card and then store it in Object Storage. Further we will also use Vision service to get required detail from the image that user took and store it in Autonomous Database.

Estimated lab time: 2 hours

### Objectives

- Provision a new Visual Builder Cloud Service Instance
- Learn how to connect to your new autonomous database using ORDS and Vision Service.

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of the **Get Started** section in the Contents menu on the left.
